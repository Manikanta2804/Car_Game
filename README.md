# Project Title
### Car Racing Game 🏎️

## Overview
The **Car Racing Game** is a simple, fun, and interactive game built using Python's Turtle graphics. The objective is to control a car and avoid obstacles while scoring points. As the score increases, the difficulty of the game increases with faster obstacle movement.

## Features 🚗
- Interactive gameplay with keyboard controls
- Dynamic obstacle movement
- Real-time score tracking
- Game Over notification

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- Python 🐍
- Turtle Graphics Module 🎯
- Random Module 🎲
- Time Module ⏱️

## How to Run the Game 🚀

1. **Install Python**
   - Make sure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manikanta2804/Car_Game.git
   ```

3. **Run the Game**
   ```bash
   python car_game.py
   ```
## Game Instructions 🎮
- **Left Arrow (⬅️)**: Move the car left.
- **Right Arrow (➡️)**: Move the car right.
- Avoid colliding with red obstacles.
- Score points by successfully dodging obstacles.

## Code Structure 🧩
- **car_game.py**: Main game logic

## How the Game Works ⚙️
- The player controls a blue car positioned at the bottom of the screen.
- Red obstacles move downward from the top.
- If the car successfully dodges an obstacle, the score increases by 1, and the obstacle speed increases.
- If the car collides with an obstacle, the game ends with a "GAME OVER" message.
